# Patryk Friday Tattoo Artist

Built a brief website for a tattoo artist. The salon he works for have their own site, this is strictly personal,
for personal growth, and to showcase his portfolio. All media on the site was provided by him, everything else is
all me.
 
## UX
 
This website is for potential customers who wish to pick out the tattoo artist that is right for them and for prospective
salons or other artists that may want to collaborate. Main purpose is to showcase the work done so far and provide a 
platform to contact him directly.

I've worked off of two wireframes.

[Initial Sketch](assets/Wireframes/initial_wireframe.jpg)

and

[Final Sketch](assets/Wireframes/final_wireframe.jpg)

Generally as a user I want to see the work of an artist via a Gallery of sorts and if I like what I see I want an easy
and straightforward way to schedule a session.

## Features

There is a showcase of most recent work on the index page.

Any user/customer have an option to book in the header and footer of every page of the website.

Small and brief About section concerning the artist himself.

Gallery to show off work done i.e. a web portfolio for everyone to access, with an option to open the image
in a new tab for greater detail.

Contact section for the final booking access point.

#### Future features

I'd like to have the web forms for bookings actually go somewhere the artist can access.

A slideshow of featured work.

## Technologies Used

The technologies used in this project do not number many. Find them below:

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** for the modals only.

- [Bootstrap 3.3.7](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/)
    - The project uses **Bootstrap** for nearly all of HTML5 and CSS3 designs.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
    - This project uses **Font Awesome** for glyphicons relating to Social Media.



## Testing

I've manually clicked every button and link on every page that I have added and confirmed that they work as
intended. All the photos in the Gallery sections lead to a new tab when clicked on which is by design.

Resolutions have been tested with Chrome dev tools, however I also opened the page on my mobile phone to have a more
hands-on experience of mobile viewport. Works as intended.

Manually checked that all the modals are functioning and are identical to each other, without typos.

Double checked that any forms (modal and contact page) have required fields so there are no blank messages coming through in the future.

Sent the link of the website to 6 of my friends as well as the Artis himself to check out and see if any bugs or discrepancies are present.
