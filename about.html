                <h3> Early life </h3>
                <p> I started practicing tattoo arts when I was fifteen years old. I really enjoyed art classes in school and had an interest in tattoo designs which lead me to tattooing myself at a young age. As time progressed and I managed to get better
                    equipment I was getting noticed by a few tattoo salons in the area. Spyder Tattoo salon invited me to do some work experience for them when I became eighteen. I learned a lot from the full time artists that worked there. Their styles
                    influenced mine greatly which I am really grateful to them.</p>
                <br/>
                <h3> Work History </h3>
                <p> I worked in Spyder Tattoo for 3 years. They had to close down after that, this left me without a steady job so I started to tattoo friends and acquintances in my room. Eventually I turned my room into a mini salon, getting a number of
                    clientele and building my portfolio and local name. This gave me the courage and confidence to go to the tattoo convention in Dublin which happens every August. This is a gathering of artists from across the globe, I was noticed there
                    by my current employer Kult Tattoo Fest. After this convention they offered me a job at their salon as well as certain expenses paid to move back to Poland to work for them. They are located in the heart of Krakow.</p>
                <br/>
                <h3> Specialties </h3>
                <p> I specialise in realism as well as portraits. Feel free to check out my extensive portrait/realism portfolio over at the <a href="gallery.html">gallery page</a>.
                    <!--img src="assets/Media/featured_2.jpg" alt="jimi_hendrix" class="img-responsive specialty-tat"--> I have dabbled in a variety of styles and can tattoo pretty much anything that is presented to me on a page.
                    If you want original designs I excel at ideas focused around realism. Alternatively if you submit a request for a portrait of someone you like please send me a photo or other inspirational material via my 
                    <a href="contact.html">contact page</a>.</p>
